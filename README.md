Creates user account, inputs user's information, and pushes it to azure database. Created at the all womens hackathon, Technica, We found our team through Slack posts prior to the event among general interest in building a mental health app. One teammate sketched a few wireframes before arriving and once we got together and met in person, we all started working on our separate pieces. We built the backend using AWS, myself and another memeber worked on the front end through Android Design Studio. Our fourth member built assets and supported design decisions while developing prototypes in Adobe XD.
